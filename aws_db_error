Have you tried to:

sudo -H gedit /etc/apache2/apache2.conf
Then add the following line to the end of the file:

Include /etc/phpmyadmin/apache.conf
Then restart apache:

/etc/init.d/apache2 restart


CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'deepak';
 GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'newuser'@'localhost';
 FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
